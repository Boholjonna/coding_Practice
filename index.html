            <p>Love is a quiet force that moves through the smallest moments — a shared glance, a gentle word, or the way two hands naturally find each other in a crowd. It doesn’t always shout; sometimes it whispers in the calm of presence, in the patience during hard times, or in the simple act of showing up. Love isn’t always perfect, but it's often real in the ways that matter most.</p>
